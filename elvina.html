				<p>So. Here comes Elvina, Elvin's female persona. Elvina is cute af. No one can ever resist her personal charm. See how we have editted our league message to "Elvin(a) is my waifu!" I used to register a Tinder account using Elvina's photo and guess how many matches I got? /puppyface. </p>

                <img src="popular.JPG" alt="His league account is NaturalDominance BTW" class="center" >
                <p>Despite Elvina is being well loved by her friends and considered as "THE WAIFU". You don't need to worry about polygamy as we hold our relationships platonic.(JK) There's only one guy you might ever need to worry about, Louie, from Louieisiana. Hes Elvina's secret crush for years. </p>
